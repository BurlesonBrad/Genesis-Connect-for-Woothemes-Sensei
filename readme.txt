This plugin integrates the Genesis Framework from Studiopress with the Woothemes Sensei plugin.

== Description ==

This plugin uses code taken from https://support.woothemes.com/hc/en-us/articles/204428855-StudioPress-Genesis.

You will need the Woothemes Sensei plugin (http://www.woothemes.com/products/sensei/) 
and the Genesis Framework and/or one of its child themes (http://www.studiopress.com).

In other words, if you are not trying to integrate the Woothemes Sensei plugin with the Genesis Framework 
and/or one of its child themes, this plugin is pretty much useless for you...

This plugin will only work (i.e. activate) with the Genesis Framework and its child themes.

== Instructions ==

Simply install and activate the plugin.

There are no settings and no settings screen.
